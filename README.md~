 Execution of Python scripts
1. Create a file in editor
2. Save the file with .py extension. Ex- Lr.py
3. Open the terminal.
4. Go the directory in which file is stored. Ex- $ cd Downloads/text_to_dxf-1.1/
5. Give the permissions to Lr.py file.
    $ chmod ugo+rwx Lr.py
6. Run the Lr.py file and create .txt file that holds coordinates (x,y) for .dxf file.
      $ ./Lr.py > Lr.txt
      You can give any name to file with .txt extension.
7. Now last step is to create .dxf file.
      $ python text_to_dxf.py Lr.txt Lr.dxf.
       Lr.dxf file is created in the directory in which you save the Lr.py file. You can open it.
